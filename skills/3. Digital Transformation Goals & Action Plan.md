Drive **digital transformation by March 2026** through automation, UX innovation, and tool-based enablement — focusing on documentation, knowledge systems, and migration use cases.

---

## ✅ Key Goals

### 1. Strengthen Understanding of Tools & Technologies
- Deep dive into relevant tools, data structures, and databases.  
- Build tool-specific understanding before entering the “problem finder” phase.

### 2. Automate Documentation & Knowledge Management
- Create a **prompt-driven documentation system**.  
- Build a **knowledge base** and **knowledge graph** for structured, reusable insights.  
- Generate “empty files” or templates to automate documentation.

### 3. Develop Real Use Cases
- Start with a **Google Drive → OneDrive migration** project as a practical application.  
- Explore integrations with **LLM Notebook**, **Map Editor**, and **Drive Extension** (preferably open-source).

### 4. UX for Small Companies
- Create **affordable UX design solutions** integrated with **Figma**.  
- Align UX workflows with **principles and guidelines**, supported by prompt-based specifications.

### 5. Knowledge Sharing & Customer Growth Principle
- Follow the cycle:  
  > **Interact → Learn → Teach → Find Customers**  
- Use this as the core principle for community and product growth.

### 6. Prepare for the “New Normal”
- Adopt transformation-oriented workflows by **March 2026**.  
- Treat automation, prompt-based design, and UX innovation as the **mandatory direction** for the future.
