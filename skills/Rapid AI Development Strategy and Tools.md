## 1. Exact Transcript of the Excerpts

**Excerpts from "WhatsApp Audio 2025-10-27 at 11.00.20.mp4":**

Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. This is one of the problem. Similarly, can pick other problems and we will try to solve it. Okay. Then okay you can able to do like before whatever if you want to build some create something means it takes **one year two year but now we can do it in one month**. Two weeks preparation one week reflection then one week execution. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's it. So to start with um subrain he made one uh MD4 attention. Okay. Or deep learning or paper. M we can take that as one example.

Okay. Okay. Well similarly we can pick other some topics in **deep learning**. Okay. **Start building knowledge basis knowledge graphs**. Okay. You who discussed with the Ganesh he told exonel event driven domain driven clean. Yes. So over there also we can apply. Okay. That's why we have subscribed a lot of uh tools right **cloud we subscribed grock charg**. So initial uh the whatever I have shown this is from the **Gemini pro**. Okay. Like this **ideations brainstorms** if we do it from the **prompts** and generate the highle idea.

Rest everything your **cursor** will Okay. Did **gap analysis**, right? And he shared. Yes. Yeah. Like that ideations we have **cursor and cloud will do**. Okay. **Cloud and cursor and cloud is for execution** and these all three tools charges for the **ideation, brainstorming**. Okay. **Problem definition and solution breakdown**. Okay. Okay. You can connect your cloud applications in between this. How to in the solutions technology layer it will come right when we discussed to **architecture**, right? Yes. Uh first **business requirements**, then comes uh **system requirements**, then **application architecture, data architecture, then only technology architecture**.

Then you start building the solution. Okay. Okay. Yep. Uh okay. I will also come up with it something if I put that problem into any **pro version** and ask what under **knowledge bases** I need to learn to uh solve this problem okay it will through lot lot of **concepts and frameworks**. Yes. For everything make one one empty file. Okay. All those empty files we can put it into **cloud**. Okay. **Cloud has recently released one features called skills**. Okay. You can create three skills there and you can feed in the knowledge basis. Then it can also go and identify it has its own knowledge base.

Right then in our own way we can try to build something. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. That's it. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Because this recording has some Um okay **clarifications on the purpose right purpose and directions**. Okay. Okay. This also we'll keep it in the **knowledge base**. Okay. In process lecture. Okay. Knowledge base we will keep like **concepts, frameworks and belief**. Okay. Okay. How if you sit and do understand everything do it with hands on some three four weeks. **It should be able to do it in one or two days time**.

Okay. But for us to consume that it will take some time. We will take some 3 4 days. **Read ideate finetune**. Okay. Yes. Okay. That's it. Okay. Bye. Okay. Bye. Okay. Bye. Bye.

## 2. Consolidated and Clarified Summary

The conversation outlines a highly accelerated, tool-driven methodology for problem-solving and solution building, focusing heavily on utilizing AI tools and established architectural principles.

### Acceleration and Timeframe

The process aims to drastically reduce development time. Historically, building or creating something might take **one to two years**, but the new process suggests completing it in **one month**. This month is broken down into two weeks for preparation, one week for reflection, and one week for execution.

Furthermore, concepts that previously required three or four weeks of hands-on learning and understanding should now be consumable and actionable in **one or two days**. However, the immediate consumption time for the team is estimated to be three to four days to **read, ideate, and fine-tune**.

### Tools and Roles

The strategy relies on several subscribed tools, including **Cloud, Groq, and Charge**. The tools are assigned specific phases in the workflow:

| Phase | Tool(s) | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ideation & Brainstorming** | Gemini Pro, Groq, Charge (All three tools) | Generating high-level ideas, problem definition, solution breakdown, and initial ideation via prompts. |
| **Execution** | Cloud and Cursor | Carrying out the solution build. Cursor specifically aids in gap analysis. |

### Knowledge Bases and Learning

A key component is the creation and management of **knowledge bases and knowledge graphs**.

1.  **Inputting Problems:** A problem can be fed into a "pro version" of an AI tool (like Gemini Pro mentioned earlier).
2.  **Identifying Requirements:** The tool then identifies the necessary **concepts and frameworks** required to solve the problem.
3.  **Creating Knowledge Files:** For every identified concept or framework, an empty file should be created.
4.  **Utilizing Cloud Skills:** These empty files (knowledge bases) are uploaded to the **Cloud**, which has a recently released feature called **'skills'**. Users can create up to three skills and feed the knowledge bases into them.
5.  **Content of Knowledge Base:** The knowledge base is designed to store **concepts, frameworks, and beliefs**. The recording itself, which clarifies the **purpose and directions**, will also be kept in the knowledge base.

### Architectural Approach

The approach for building solutions must follow a specific architectural hierarchy:

1.  **Business Requirements**
2.  **System Requirements**
3.  **Application Architecture**
4.  **Data Architecture**
5.  **Technology Architecture**

The approach also involves applying principles discussed with Ganesh, such as **event driven, domain driven, and clean architecture** principles.

### Examples

The conversation mentions starting with a specific example: **Subrain made one MD4 attention**, or a deep learning paper, which can be used as a starting point. The team should also pick other topics in deep learning to build knowledge bases.
